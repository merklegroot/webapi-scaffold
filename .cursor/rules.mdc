# .NET Project Rules

## Project Structure
- Always use a solution file (.sln) and generate it using the .NET CLI
- Use .NET 8.0 for all new projects and generate them using the .NET CLI
- Include a .gitignore file and generate it using the .NET CLI

## CLI Commands
- Generate solution: `dotnet new sln`
- Generate projects: `dotnet new [project-type]`
- Generate .gitignore: `dotnet new gitignore`

## Code Style and Patterns
- Use records over classes except for situations where memory size is a major concern
- Prefer init-only properties in most cases
- Prefer init-only over primary constructor as this ensures that client code has to specify which property is being set and eliminates confusion where client code can misunderstand which property it's setting
- Prefer properties to be required unless there's a reasonable situation where the property might not be set

## Best Practices
- Prefer CLI-generated files over manually created ones
- Use .NET 8.0 as the target framework
- Maintain consistent
